            <p>E-books are not actually the substitute for the traditional print book since print book offers not only information, but also the reading experience.</p>
            <p>People may mix up the term “searching information” with “reading”. Reading is the activity through with you are enjoying throughout the experience. 
            <p>On the other hand, searching information is a way of “learning” and “developing” yourself. Googling is enough for getting information, and if that’s not enough, E-textbooks are also used by some students for its flexibility in searching the content, easy accessibility, enhanced visual appeal, and possible multimedia content, meaning it is a good source for “learning”.( Senthilkumaran Piramanayagam, 2020). However, when it comes to the reading experience, print books are always people’s go-to.</p>

            <p>There are some special form of print books such as 3D books that contain interactive elements that can never be replaced by e-book.</p>
            <p>For example, there is the 3D print books for children which allows some physical interactions with children. For instance, there are some 3D paper model standing on the page, or there are finger sleeves which serve as interactive elements. Those forms of interaction require the book to not only be a stack of flat papers, but some geometric variances out of traditional books. </p>
